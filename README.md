# Timer 52 / 17

The 52-minute timer is based on an article I read in which they gathered data from the most productive users on DeskTime and found 52 minutes of working, followed by a 17-minute long break is extremely effective.

## Getting Started

Press space to pause and space again to resume. Notice that the percentage font will change to a rosy pink when paused. The font will change back to white when resumed.

Use the command below to see more detailed information in the console.

```
Ctrl + Shift + 'J'
```
